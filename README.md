# covid_vs_non-covid
Binary Classification of ct scan images of covid-19 and non covid images
-Distinguishing COVID-19 from normal lung or other lung diseases, such as lungs cancer, bacterial pneumonia, may be a major hurdle in controlling the current pandemic.

-Manual radiologist interpretation of chest CT for recognizing COVID-19 by its characteristic patterns that include peripheral ground-glass opacities, but unfortunately this measure often has low specificity.

-Therefore, an efficient classification method using neural network and transfer learning can give us better accuracy in classification of CT scan.


# visulization of covid and non-covid
-From the image we can see that covid-19 ct scan has round glass opacities which is not seen in the non- covid patient ct.
-These feature can be used to classify the images but with help of  convolution neural network (CNN) which are specially designed for feature detection can give better classification results.
