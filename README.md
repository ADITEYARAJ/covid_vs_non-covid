Binary Classification of ct scan images of covid-19 and non covid images
Distinguishing COVID-19 from normal lung or other lung diseases, such as lungs cancer, bacterial pneumonia, may be a major hurdle in controlling the current pandemic.

Manual radiologist interpretation of chest CT for recognizing COVID-19 by its characteristic patterns that include peripheral ground-glass opacities, but unfortunately this measure often has low specificity.

Therefore, an efficient classification method using neural network and transfer learning can give us better accuracy in classification of CT scan.
